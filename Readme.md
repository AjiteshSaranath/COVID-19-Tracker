COVID 19 Tracker Website
In this project, I have done a COVID 19 tracker website that has a good user GUI which can be run in Chrome as a local host, to know further download the zip file and
understand the flow of data as well as what the project means, it also utilises a phpmailer which allows an user of the website to give feedback to the developer.
Its 95% completed, only CSS editing needed here and there to beautify the webpage further (if required).
